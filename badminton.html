<p>Badminton is a racquet game, players use a racquet to hit a shuttle across a net. Singles are more commonly played, though the game can be played with large teams. Points are scored when a player hits a shuttle across the net and it hits the opponent’s side of the court. It was developed in British India from the french game of Battledore and Shuttlecock.</p>
<h2 id="origin-of-badminton">Origin of Badminton</h2>
<p>The exact origin of Badminton as it is played today remains unclear but shuttlecock games have been played for centuries. Though we know that it derived from a french game called Battledore and Shuttlecock which used racquets. It became a popular game among expatriate officers in British India during the 1870s although it was not referred to as ‘Badminton’. The name probably derives from the Duke of Beaufort’s Badminton House in south england. 
The Badminton Association of England published the official rules written by JHE Hart in 1893. Badminton debuted in the 1992 Olympic Games with 74 nations competing. Today it is governed by the Badminton World Federation. China leads the medal tally with 20 gold medals.</p>

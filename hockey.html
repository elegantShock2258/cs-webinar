<p>Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent’s goal using a hockey stick. Hockey can be played on a field, turf or ice. Field Hockey was introduced at the Olympic games as a Men’s competition in 1908. Women’s Hockey competition was introduced in 1980. Since the 1976 games, field hockey has been played on artificial turf. Team India leads the medal tally (12 medals; 8 golds) to this date. 
Origin of hockey ; 
The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity; historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Greece around 500 BCE. Hockey-like games were also found in East Asian and South American countries. Modern rules of Hockey arose out of small cricket clubs in Britain that played it as a winter game.</p>
